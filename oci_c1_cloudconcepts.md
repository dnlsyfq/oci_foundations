# Cloud Concepts

## Cloud Computing

1. On-demand self-service
  * Provision computing capabilities as needed automatically w/o human interaction with service provider

2. Broad Network Access
  * Available over the network

3. Resource pooling
  * Provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different resources
  dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand 

4. Rapid elasticity 
  * capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically , to scale rapidly 
  outward and inward with demand 
  * i.e demand increases, get more resources , vice versa , demand not much , release resources 
  
5. Measured service 
  * resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported providing transparency for both the provider and 
    consumer of the utilized service 
  * i.e. pay as you go, consumption based pricing 
  
## Service models 

### Traditional IT

|-Applications (Consumer Manage)
|-Data (Consumer Manage)
|-Runtime (Consumer Manage)
|-Middleware (Consumer Manage)
|-Operating System (Consumer Manage)
|-Virtualization (Consumer Manage)
|-Servers (Consumer Manage)
|-Storage (Consumer Manage)
|-Networking (Consumer Manage)

### Infrastructure as a service 

|-Applications (Consumer Manage)
|-Data (Consumer Manage)
|-Runtime (Consumer Manage)
|-Middleware (Consumer Manage)
|-Operating System (Consumer Manage) 
|-Virtualization (Delivered as a service)
|-Servers (Delivered as a service)
|-Storage (Delivered as a service)
|-Networking (Delivered as a service)

  ### Platform as a service
  * serverless @ Oracle Functions 
  
|-Applications (Consumer Manage)
|-Data (Consumer Manage)
|-Runtime (Delivered as a service)
|-Middleware (Delivered as a service)
|-Operating System (Delivered as a service)
|-Virtualization (Delivered as a service)

|-Storage (Delivered as a service)
|-Networking (Delivered as a service)

### Software as a service 

|-Applications (Delivered as a service)
|-Data (Delivered as a service)
|-Runtime (Delivered as a service)
|-Middleware (Delivered as a service)
|-Operating System (Delivered as a service)
|-Virtualization (Delivered as a service)
|-Servers (Delivered as a service)
|-Storage (Delivered as a service)
|-Networking (Delivered as a service)

## High availability 

* computing environments configured to provide nearly full time availability = high availability systems 

* built in redundant hardware / software , to avoid having single points of failure 

* When failures occur, the failover process moves processing performed by the failed component to the backup components.
